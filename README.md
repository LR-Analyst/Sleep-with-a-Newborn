# Sleep-with-a-Newborn

### Description:
I’ve had a Garmin fitness watch for a while and have learned a lot from (and even had fun with) a lot of the metrics that it reports in its accompanying app. I decided to go beyond the app and take a deeper dive into the evolution of my sleep patterns around my second child’s birth (+/- 4 months). All of the data was exported from my watch in a semi-structured format.

### Tools Used:
R, Power BI

### Included Files:
1. Power BI viz with key metrics and a timeline progression.
2. The R code used to unpack, clean, and analyze the data.
3. Exploratory tables/plots from R used while exploring the data.
